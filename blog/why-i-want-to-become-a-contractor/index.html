<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>This is my first English blog post. In this post, I will try to explain why I want to be a contractor and the way how I will become a contractor.</p>

<p>There is one thing in my life which is the key thing makes me ever happy is <em>continuous learning</em> and what keeps me motivated is challenging. I was a child, I wanted to be a scientist. Which is not a good career path in my country. I chose software development. Somehow I found them similar.</p>

<p>I learnt programming before college and I even made money from it. It was a freelancing job and I had a good salary for a teenage boy. Then I co-founded a business with two of my best friends and it was even greater than freelancing. Even it was not a very successful business, we learnt a lot from it made lots of fun. During my career, by luck or my personal curiosity, I had to choose a different technology for each project I worked on and I had to learn each programming language or framework from scratch. Perhaps, It was the only way to take the control over my hunger for learning, trying and discovering new technologies.</p>

<p>During college and after college, I kept trying different technologies again and again. When I discovered <em>Ruby</em> and <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, I fell in love with them. The clean syntax and mature ecosystem helped to adapt very quickly. I built projects and had so much fun with RoR.</p>

<p>I tried various design patterns with various programming languages. I tried both object oriented programming and functional programming approaches. I developed desktop applications. I worked as both frontend and backend developer roles. I am not specialized on any specific technology. Luckily I have a taste of many software development technologies and that helped to become a very adaptive developer.</p>

<p>My dear friends, it has been more than 10 years since I started my first company. And I also worked as a regular employee in a couple of companies. Finally, I realized that there is no perfect world that I can find a company to work at that I can be fully qualified and become useful in a logical sense with my polyglot experiences(Of course I mean in my city.). That’s why I have decided to become a contractor. I want to share my skills and experiences with a company which really demands them from me.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I found TopTal as a chance to give a try to achieve my goal. To sustain my learning hunger, to help companies to digitize their ideas and to work at whereever I want. I want to become a contractor. Not just an ordinary contractor, also be one of the top Toptal Ruby on Rails Developers.</p>

<p>Thank you all for reading.</p>
